This is a crap repo that implements stack switching and a scheduler in C11.
This method is sometimes called "fibers" but also "green threading" or "user
space threading".

It doesn't do error checking, it doesn't do memory safety, I wouldn't use it
for anything. It's just something I'm playing around with.
